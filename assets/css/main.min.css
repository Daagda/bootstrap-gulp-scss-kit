/* Compiled and minified CSS will be here after modifying /css/main.css
 * while running gulp.
 *
 * The current gulp script does the following:
 *  1. Listens for any modifications in /scss/*.scss
 *  2. When modification is discovered, immediately compiles from
 *     /scss/FILENAME.scss to /css/FILENAME.css
 *  3. Immediately afterward, minifies and renames from FILENAME.css
 *     to FILENAME.min.css
 *
 * Hence editing /scss/main.scss will compily and minify the content
 * and rename /css/main.css file to this file. You can modify any of
 * these three features in the gulp.js file.
 *
 * This message will be gone after main.scss compilation â€” it will be
 * only visible on repo in original state.
